<h2 align= "center">Why I love Steve Jobs</h2>

<body>Steve Jobs was a misfit who founded a company and gave thousands of other misfits value and a place in society. 
    many of his employees and those who worked closely to him said that he was a generous man who cared about the well
    being of his employees. It was said that when the company went downhill financially, he decided to take his pay and 
    give it to the poeple that worked for him. During those tough years he earned only a $1 yearly salary.Tim Cook also reported
    that Steve Jobs also gave $60 million to stanford hospitals and donated it to cancer recearch. Jobs also gave $75 million to African 
    goverment to help fight aids. </body>

    <h2 align= "center">Why I love Cyrus the Great</h2>

    <body>Cyrus the great founded the Achaemenid Empire. he controlled 45% of the worlds population. Why this is one of favoirte leaders
        is that he became the first leader in history to ban slavery. He also gave conquered peoples the right to freely worship and pick 
        their religeon. He gave people who were persecuted like the jewish community a place to live in his empire. In greek literature he is
        revered as someone who is brave, bold and tolerant. Many leaders like ALexander the great for example looked up to him and admired him.
        many of his tolerant policies were rooted in zoroastrianism which was the first monotheistic religeon. under his rule he provided finacial 
        support to building the temple of Jerusalem. He has had a huge impact of the lives of many world leaders and his message of tolerance
        and peace lives on.
