<h2 align= "center">Why I love Steve Jobs</h2>

<body>Steve Jobs was a misfit who founded a company and gave thousands of other misfits value and a place in society. 
    many of his employees and those who worked closely to him said that he was a generous man who cared about the well
    being of his employees. It was said that when the company went downhill financially, he decided to take his pay and 
    give it to the poeple that worked for him. During those tough years he earned only a $1 yearly salary.Tim Cook also reported
    that Steve Jobs also gave $60 million to stanford hospitals and donated it to cancer recearch. Jobs also gave $75 million to African 
    goverment to help fight aids. </body>
